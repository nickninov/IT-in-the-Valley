# IT in the Valley - UWL React Native and MongoDB coursework

The mobile application is based on the study case - IT Magazine. The magazine consists of 4 main departments - Marketing, Editing, Processing and Accounts. A mobile application is made to help the Marketing department receive content from advertisers, journalists and photographers and help the Editing department edit the approved data that will be published to the magazine.

To develop the mobile application for the study case - React Native was used for front end development and Node.js and MongoDB were used for back end development - to access the server and store the data.
